/**
 * <pre>
 * Condition: Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)
 * Only one result condition:
 *          If a topological sort has the property that all pairs of consecutive vertices in
 *          the sorted order  are connected by edges, then these edges form a directed
 *          Hamiltonian path in the DAG.
 *          If a Hamiltonian path exists, the topological sort order is unique;
 *
 * 1> Kahn's algorithm(BFS)
 *    See used in {@link Leetcode269AlienDictionary}
 *    Data structures:
 *      2 map<node, set<node>>: 'ins'(1:n), 'outs' (1:n)
 *                               ins can be map<node, Integer>. But this is not good choice as this need
 *                               to avoid duplicated operations to increase the Integer value
 *                               for 2 same relation or use map<node, list<ode> data structure for `out`
 *      set<node> all: all nodes in graph, this can be merged with indegree maps `ins`, but
 *                     not good as concept is not clean
 *      queue: nodes with no incoming edges.
 *      list/String (keep result)
 *
 *    Algorithm steps:
 *      initial `all` set
 *      find out all edge to initial `in` and `out`
 *      initial queue by all.removeAll(in.keySet())
 *      while(  queue  is not  empty) {
 *        BFS:
 *          if current node `k` has not out set `value`, provide a empty set, do not run into null pointer.
 *                                                       or initial out with an empty set during initialize the `all`
 *          remove key in ins if its value set is empty: no ins for this node
 *      }
 *      if  `ins` set is not empty
 *          return error (graph has at least one cycle)
 *
 *
 *    Algorithm  cons:
 *           need has ins;
 *           need find out all nodes(Kept in `all` set) and edges(kept in and out maps).
 *           need update the ins
 *
 *    Algorithm pros: can detect circle. do not need "visited" Set to check circle
 *    O(V+E) time and space
 *      todo A variation of Kahn's algorithm that breaks ties lexicographically forms a key component
 *      of the Coffman–Graham algorithm for parallel scheduling and layered graph drawing.
 *
 *  2> Depth-first search(Assume it is DAG. no circle, need
 *    - checking circle before running this algorithm)
 *    - or merge  checking circle with  topological sort order together see
 *      See used in {@link Leetcode269AlienDictionary}
 *
 *  data structure:
 *    Set: keep all nodes
 *    map: only outs
 *    stack:  to keep the result during on the back forward path
 *    Set: visited. avoid duplicated at merge point.
 *         Not be used to checking circle.
 *
 *   steps:  from each node to try DFS +  post order to keep result
 *
 *    cons:  need check circle firstly
 *    pros:  need not update the edge/connection relationship in indegree map, so no indegree map
 *
 *   O(V+E) time and space
 *  todo The topological order can also be used to quickly compute shortest paths through
 *  a weighted directed(negative wight is allowed) acyclic graph.
