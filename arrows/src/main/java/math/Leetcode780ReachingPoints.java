    A move consists of taking a point (x, y) and transforming
    it to either (x, x+y) or (x+y, y).
    Given a starting point (sx, sy) and a target point (tx, ty),
    return True if and only if a sequence of moves exists to
    transform the point (sx, sy) to (tx, ty). Otherwise, return False.

    sx, sy, tx, ty will all be integers in the range [1, 10^9].

  Idea:
   All are positive number
