  You should add k new gas stations. You can add the stations anywhere on the x-axis,
  and not necessarily on an integer position.
  Let penalty() be the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations
  after adding the k new stations.
  Return the smallest possible value of penalty().

    10 <= stations.length <= 2000
    0 <= stations[i] <= 10^8

    the original bus station location is integer.
    the new bug station location may be real number with a infinite circle decimal

   Idea:
     binary search
     - initial value l = 0 and r = 1e8 is the search space of smallest possible value of max distance of
       any adjacent 2 gas stations. this search space is monotonic and binary search can be applied here
     - try a value in the search space calculated by binary search to see with it(Double)
       how many new bus stations (Integer) can be added in total in a manner with which for any 2 existing
       adjacent gas stations the new gas station(s) are evenly allocated in the interval.
     - what we want to get from the predicate after comparing the possible added new station
       number with K is only the heuristic hint which can let us know we should make the next distance
       value used to try to be smaller or bigger than the current one.
       thus continue trying till step in the a accepted shrink search space and stop there.
       This is binary search character in real number search space.
       So handle the scenario of
         new gas station number n and K:
         n < K  : current value is bigger that target one. try a smaller value
         n > K  : current value is smaller that target one. try a bigger value
         how about  n == K, let l=mid or let r=mid? and why?
             Note: the first distance value used to try is (0+max)/2
             for any interval of 2 adjacent existing gas stations,
             when n == K happen for the first time the last distance value
             is a bigger one that the one which firstly make n == K happen.
             at that time if use l=mid, then with this rule the following distance value
             will be bigger than the current one again as before and at last reach an extreme
             where still can allowing to add n==K but the fraction is nearly 0.
             at the time when n == K happens for the first time, even the value of n
             is expected but the distance value may be not the one which can
             evenly allocate the new gas stations. in this case still need tuning
             it to be smaller in next step without increasing the number of n
             because the required distance is the one who will make smallest possible
             value of penalty(). for this reason use r=mid.
             E.g. stations=[0,1] ,K=1. with the l=mid rule then the distance will eventually
             reach to 0.9999.. still keeping n==1. but not evenly allocated.

    'Answers within 10^-6 of the actual answer will be accepted.'
     means: the search space shrink to where any 2 value's diff is < 10^-6
           then the search can terminate and any answer in that search space is
           acceptable.

      O(NlogW) time. W is the value of the last element value of station.
      O(1) space
