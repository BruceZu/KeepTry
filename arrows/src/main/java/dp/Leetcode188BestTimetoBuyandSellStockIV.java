  /*
  an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
  find the maximum profit. You may complete
  at most k transactions.
  you must sell the stock before you buy again.
   */

  /*
   Idea: state machine.
     when K is bigger enough the answer is profit got by no times limitation transactions
     any times of transaction on the first day will get profit 0, as only one price
     the price diff is 0.

     candidate-cost[k]: the cost value for the candidate kth transaction which is
        assumed to be done by selling with today price
        It is a minimum value selected from
        0th price - 0                              ( happened on price[0] on 0th day)
        1th price - profit of previous transaction ( happened on price[1] on 1th day)
        2th price - profit of previous transaction ( happened on price[2] on 2th day)
        ...
        today price - profit of previous transaction ( happened on price[today] on today day)
        it = min{it, current price minus cumulated profit after previous transaction, kept in
        max-profit[k-1]}
        The cost value may not happen( by buy action) on today
        and it is affected by the previous 0~k-1 transaction.
        initial value is MAX. for each transaction in -1 day the candidate-cost[k], which is a min value,
        is MAX,

     max-profit[k]: profit value in hand after kth transaction's sell action which may
        happen on a day before today.
        it is a max value, selected from
        it == max{it, current price - cost[k]}.
        The sell action of the kth transaction with max profit may not happen
        today and in that case it has been calculated and kept in max-profixi].
        if the sell action of the ith transaction with max profit happens
        today, it depends on the just calculated cost[k].

        max-profit[k] is also the profit after all 0-k transactions
        initial value is 0
        max-profit[k-1]: when the 0th transaction buy action happen the
                 cost will be today price - max-profit[k-1] which is 0.
                 -1 out of 0 based index.
       when current is the 1th transaction. the profit at hand is 0;
       initialized with 0 which is the cumulated profit got after -1
       transaction

    candidate-cost[k] in i days depends on
       - left:  candidate-cost[k] in i-1 days
       - above: max-profit[k-1] in i days
    max-profit[k] in i days depends on
       - left:  max-profit[k] in i-1 days
       - above: candidate-cost[k] in i days


  Notice: the order it make sure
       "at most k transactions. you must sell the stock before you buy again."

   O(N*K) time and O(K) space

  /*
  The logic is same as above
            -1    day 0,    ...,      c-1,          c,           ..., N-1
   tx 1
   tx 2
   tx 3
   ...       0   p(r-1)(0), ...,      p(r-1)(c-1)    p(r-1)(c)
   tx r                               p(r)  (c-1)    p(r)  (c)
   ...
   tx k

   current the max profit `p(r)` after r transaction in first c days depends on
         - the max profit after r transaction in first c-1 days `p(r)(c-1)`
         - the cost of one of the rth transaction which happens in first
           c days, the one here is the one happens today or sold with
           today's price. The cost is the minimum value:
             price(c day)   - p(r-1)(c)
             price(c-1 day) - p(r-1)(c-1)
             ...
             price(1 day)   - p(r-1)(0)
             price(0 day)   - 0
   It shows:
       - if calculate  max profit(r)(c) column by column and use another array to keep min cost
         for the one of the ith transaction, the one that sell with today's price.
         then only need 1 dimension array p(r) for current c day.
         So the space is O(K)
       - if calculate max profit(r)(c) row by row then need, and we keep the above `min cost`
         only in a variable to also use 1 dimension array to keep p(c) for current
         transaction. it is used in this method
         So the space is O(N)
