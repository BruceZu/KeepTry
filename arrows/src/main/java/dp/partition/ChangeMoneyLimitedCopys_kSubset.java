   * There are lots of different variations of this problem. Sometimes, instead of a sum, we
   * are interested in the product, and our coins are prime numbers. Then this algorithm is somewhat
   * similar to the sieve of Erastosthenes.
   *
   * Other times, we might want to find a subset of a
   * particular size k, whose sum is m. In this case, we might want to make the table
   * two­dimensional, k­by­n, and use each row to generate the next one.
