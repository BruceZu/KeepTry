  Ask:
  Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target,
  find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
  Return the sum of the three integers.
  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

  3 <= nums.length <= 10^3
  -10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3
  -10^4 <= target <= 10^4

  So user int[] and int for nums and target
  cases:
      note: 3 <= nums.length <= 10^3
      [2,2,2,2], 8, return 0;
      note: You may assume that each input would have
            exactly one solution

   O(N^2)time, O(1ï¼‰assume Arrays.sort(A) use O(1) space
   Arrays.sort(A):  O(NlogN) time, space is depends on, O(N) or O(1)
