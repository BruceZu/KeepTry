package leetcode;/*
Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, nums, return all possible subsets.

Note:
Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
For example,
If nums = [1,2,2], a solution is:

[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
