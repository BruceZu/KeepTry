 * Assuming it is possible to sort n numbers in O(nlogn) time, show that it is possible
 * to solve the three-way set disjointness problem in O(nlogn) time.
 * <p/>
 * Suppose we are given three sets, A, B, andC, stored in three different integer arrays.
 * We will assume that no individual set contains duplicate values, but that there may be
 * some numbers that are in two or three of the sets.
 * The three-way set disjointness problem is to determine if the intersection of the three
 * sets is empty, namely, that there is no element x such that x ∈ A, x ∈ B, and x ∈ C.
