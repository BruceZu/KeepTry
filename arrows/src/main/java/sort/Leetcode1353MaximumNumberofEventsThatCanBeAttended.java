  /*
    1 <= events.length <= 10^5
    events[i].length == 2
    1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^5

    Idea:
    1> sort the meetings with start day + end day in ascending order
    2> figure out the day scope of [1, max] possible to attend a meeting
    3> for each day: if there is available meetings, then use a min heap keeping
       the end day of each meeting. to select out the earlier closed one
       to attend, the one
        - will end earlier than any others.
        - end day is today day or after today. or not finished yet
        - has started.
       those not be selected meetings, has started, are left in the
       min heap and will take part in the next day's selection.
  Note: put all meetings in min heap does not work
      e.g. [[1,2],[1,2],[3,3],[1,5],[1,5]]

           -----
           -----
             --
             --
      the [3,3] is covered by [1,5],[1,5]
      another case [1,5][1,5][3,4][3,4]
