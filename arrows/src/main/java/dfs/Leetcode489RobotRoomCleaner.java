  // Solution -----------------------------------------------------------------
  /*
        1.all cells marked as 1 will be accessible by the robot.
        2.The initial direction of the robot will be facing up
        3.require: clean the entire room
        Thinking:
        how to know entire room has all been cleaned: try 4 direction and back to original point

       Idea:
        use recursion: clean un-visited cell and try 4 direction,
        at last back to the specified location with a back direction of original direction.
       skill:
       -  for each move(), need to know the move direction,
          tracking the location and direction of move is for updating visited cells
       -  during try 4 direction: after try, back to 'current location and direction' before move

       when we should step back from current recursion if we can not move further or
       all direction has been tried

       O(Nâˆ’M) time and space, N is cell number, M is number of 0/obstacles cells
