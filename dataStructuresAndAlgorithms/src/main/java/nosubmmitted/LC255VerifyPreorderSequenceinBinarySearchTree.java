 * You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.
 * <p/>
 * Follow up:
 * Could you do it using only constant space complexity?

     * <p/>
     * Since given preorder sequence, the first element is always the root.
     * Partition the array by the key of root, find the index of the first number greater than it.
     * <p/>
     * Base case:
     * <p/>
     * start index exceeds end index, the array to be checked is empty, return true;
     * root key is not within upper and lower boundaries, return false.Ã¥
     *
     * other ideas of c++
     * The idea is traversing the preorder list and using a stack to store all predecessors.
     * currp is a predecessor of current node and current node is in the right subtree of currp.
     * For example, for the following bst with preorder 6,3,1,2,5,4,7:
     *      6
     *    /  \
     *   3    7
     *  / \
     * 1  5
     * \  /
     * 2 4
     We push to stack before we see 2. So at 2 the stack is 6,3,1. For 2,
     we pop stack until we see 3 which is greater than 2 and currp is 1. 2 is in left subtree of 3 and is
     right child of 1. Stack is 6,3,2 now. Then we see 5, and we pop stack until 6 and currp is 3.
     Stack now is 6,5. Then we see 4 and push to stack. At 7, we pop stack until empty and curr_p is 6.
