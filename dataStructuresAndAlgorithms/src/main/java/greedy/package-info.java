 *  Greedy:
 *    "the best local choice among all feasible choices available on that step".
 *    a greedy algorithm never reconsiders its choices
 *    Greedy algorithms are looking at a local point and doing some choice with the data at this point.
 *    You don't want to try all intermediate places. You goto the nearest intermediate place.
 *
 *    we can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblems that arise later.
 *    The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices made so far but not on future choices or
 *    all the solutions to the subproblem.  So, we suppose that our local optimal choice will also be global,
 *    but sometimes, it fails.
