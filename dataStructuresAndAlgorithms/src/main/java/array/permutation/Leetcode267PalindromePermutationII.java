/**
 * 267. Palindrome Permutation II
 * Difficulty: Medium <pre>
 * Given a string s, return all the palindromic permutations (without duplicates) of it.
 * Return an empty list if no palindromic permutation could be form.
 * <p/>
 * For example:
 * <p/>
 * Given s = "aabb", return ["abba", "baab"].
 * <p/>
 * Given s = "abc", return [].
 * <p/>
 * Hint:
 * <p/>
 * If a palindromic permutation exists, we just need to generate the first half of the string.
 * To generate all distinct permutations of a (half of) string, use a similar approach from: Permutations II or Next Permutation.

    /**
     * same as above
     * My first solution was a typical hashmap/backtracking 7 ms one. However,
     * I didn't particularly like the part when it checks whether there are any
     * instances of a character left. That's the part that looks something like this:
     * <p/>
     * int count = e.getValue();
     * if (count == 0) {
     * continue;
     * }
     * When we get closer and closer to the middle, these line hit more and more often,
     * so we end up running almost the entire loop in vain. So I thought that it would be
     * nice to remove the character from the list for good when the count reaches zero.
     * But if we do that with a hashtable, the iterations will start throwing
     * ConcurrentModificationException. So we need to store characters with counts
     * in a structure that supports instant removals and re-insertions (for backtracking).
     * That's obviously a linked list. We can't use LinkedList, though because of
     * the same reasonâ€”concurrent modifications aren't allowed. So I had to roll out
     * my simple singly-linked list implementation.
     * <p/>
     * This only improved 7 ms to 6 ms. That's not a big surprise, though, since
     * it's still the same order complexity. I got 2 ms by doing away with the hashmap.
     * <p/>
     * On a side note, I see a lot of solutions using int[128] or int[256] for the
     * frequency table. This will obviously screw up anything containing non-ASCII
     * characters and the problem does not say it's limited to Latin characters.
     * One interesting question to ask if you encounter this problem at an interview
     * is are characters limited to ASCII or even BMP. Because if there are characters
     * outside BMP, we may have to handle surrogate pairs, so even int[65536] / HashMap<Character, Int>
     * solutions are, strictly speaking, incorrect!
