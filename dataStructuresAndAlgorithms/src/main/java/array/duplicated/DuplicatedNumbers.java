     * <pre>
     * Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1,
     * with any of these numbers appearing any number of times.
     * Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.
     *
     * For example:
     *      let n be 7 and array be {1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6},
     *      the answer should be 1, 3 and 6.
     *
     *
     * Idea:
     *   All elements > 0; So => value as index, check times.
     *   n elements from 0 to n-1. So => value as index, check sign.
