An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number.

Under the policy, a web browser permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page,
but only if both web pages have the same origin

This policy prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page
through that page's Document Object Model.

This mechanism bears a particular significance for modern web applications that extensively depend on HTTP cookies
to maintain authenticated user sessions, as servers act based on the HTTP cookie information to
reveal sensitive information or take state-changing actions.
A strict separation between content provided by unrelated sites must be maintained on the client-side
to prevent the loss of data confidentiality or integrity.
